# Convolutions for Sequence Modeling

This repository provides implementations and experiments for the following papers, as well as simplified presentations of earlier work such as [S4](https://github.com/HazyResearch/state-spaces).

Please see these instructions for how to download weights and run our pretrained models:
* [H3](https://github.com/HazyResearch/H3/tree/main/examples) (125m-2.7B)
* [Hyena](https://github.com/HazyResearch/safari/blob/main/experiments.md#downstream-evaluations) (small, 150M)

### Roadmap
- ~~Include H3, LLM training, and synthetics in this repository~~
- ~~Move in fast convolution code~~
- ~~Add Hyena implementation and experiments~~
- pip package

### Changelog
See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

## Setup

### Requirements
This repository requires Python 3.8+ and Pytorch 1.10+.
Other packages are listed in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt).

## Getting Started
The easiest way to get started is to run the [`standalone_cifar.py`](./standalone_cifar.py) script.
This scripts trains a simple long convolution model on CIFAR-10:
```
python -m standalone_cifar
```

See the [experiments](./experiments.md) page for more:
* LRA experiments from the Long Convs paper
* H3 experiments (language model, synthetics)
* H3 + Long Conv experiments
* Hyena language and vision experiments

## Resources

We're happy to share independent reimplementations and explainer posts about methods presented in this repository. 

#### Hyena: 
* [irhum's JAX reimplementation and comparison with nanoGPT](https://github.com/irhum/hyena)
* [exps's reimplementation](https://github.com/expz/annotated-hyena) and [explainer post](https://medium.com/@jskowera/the-annotated-hyena-3e50e0aa372a)
